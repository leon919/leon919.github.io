            <p> This website allows people to record their items they would like to buy but not yet ready to go shop. This website is generally for people who do grocery shopping. If someone is running out of supplies at home but not ready to go out to shop then the person could use this tool to record the items that are missing. Once the person is ready to go shopping, he/she can bring the list to the supermarket or use the list while shopping online.
